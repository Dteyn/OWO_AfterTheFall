## After the Fall OWO skin mod
This mod is based on the work of [Florian](https://github.com/floh-bhaptics).

## Warning
Let me be very clear up front: After The Fall is a multiplayer game. If you try to cheat via mods, you are likely going to get your account banned, and nobody will like you. Even with this workaround, After The Fall will know that you are running a mod, and it will tell you right at startup that it knows. This mod here should be fine, it is not cheating and only provides additional immersive feedback, as anyone can see in this source code.

## Installation
Get the [BepInEx version](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/download/v6.0.0-pre.2/BepInEx-Unity.IL2CPP-win-x64-6.0.0-pre.2.zip) and extract it to the root folder of the game. Download the latest release of the mod and unzip the contents into the "./BepinEx/Plugins" directory of your game. That's it. Start your OWO app in the same network, connect to the OWO skin, and start up the game.

## Manual Connection
If you are having trouble with the automatic connection, create a .txt file called OWO_Manual_IP.txt and write the IP of where you placed the OWO mod.
