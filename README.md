## After the Fall OWO skin mod

This repo hosts a build of the OWO AfterTheFall mod for **BepInEx 6.0.0-pre1**.

The main repo hosts a version for BepInEx 6.0.0-pre2, which is incompatible with 6.0.0-pre1 due to changes made between pre1 and pre2. If you are using mods which require BIE 6.0.0-pre1, you'll need this version instead of the one on the main repo.

No changes have been mode aside from changing references to [BepInEx 6.0.0-pre1](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v6.0.0-pre.1) and recompiling.

# Original README.md below:

## After the Fall OWO skin mod
This mod is based on the work of [Florian](https://github.com/floh-bhaptics).

## Warning
Let me be very clear up front: After The Fall is a multiplayer game. If you try to cheat via mods, you are likely going to get your account banned, and nobody will like you. Even with this workaround, After The Fall will know that you are running a mod, and it will tell you right at startup that it knows. This mod here should be fine, it is not cheating and only provides additional immersive feedback, as anyone can see in this source code.

## Installation
Get the [BepInEx version 6.0.0-pre1](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/download/v6.0.0-pre.1/BepInEx_UnityIL2CPP_x64_6.0.0-pre.1.zip) and extract it to the root folder of the game. Download the latest release of the mod and unzip the contents into the "./BepinEx/Plugins" directory of your game. That's it. Start your OWO app in the same network, connect to the OWO skin, and start up the game.

## Manual Connection
If you are having trouble with the automatic connection, create a .txt file called OWO_Manual_IP.txt and write the IP of where you placed the OWO mod.
