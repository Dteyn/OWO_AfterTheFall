## After the Fall OWO skin mod
This mod is based on the work of [Florian](https://github.com/floh-bhaptics).

## Installation
Get the [BepInEx version](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/download/v6.0.0-pre.2/BepInEx-Unity.IL2CPP-win-x64-6.0.0-pre.2.zip) and extract it to the root folder of the game. Download the latest release of the mod and unzip the contents into the "./BepinEx/Plugins" directory of your game. That's it. Start your OWO app in the same network, connect to the OWO skin, and start up the game.

## Manual Connection
If you are having trouble with the automatic connection, create a .txt file called OWO_Manual_IP.txt and write the IP of where you placed the OWO mod.
